Greatings, mortals.
I'll skip all introductions, for you don't need to know my name.
For now, you only need to know that I seek. . . entertainment.
Simply put, I seek to watch you either rise, or fall.
Amuse me, and I'll let you live.
Otherwise. . . well you know the rest.
So let's play a game, shall we?
I'm not a patient god, so I will not bore you nor I with a list of rules.
For basics, you will navigate, you will search for room keys, you will find the exit, you will survive.
For the sake of simplicity, you will be an X, my rooms will be R's, and your exit is an E.
Yes, I know, very simple and creative. Sometimes my genius frightens me.
Most importantly, don't waste my time nor let my amusement go from 100 to 0.
Deal?
Excellent. Now, let us play, shall we?
I'll accept whatever you say as yes.
Now, seeing as you all have nothing but gold on you,
I'll feel charitable and let you meet a merchant.
Good luck, and entertain me.
Greetings! I'm your new source of charity!
(Though I'm basically a merchant and I don't give items for free)
Luckily for you, you have some gold on you!
(Otherwise, I would left you poor jackasses out to dry in this fiery hell)
(Between you lumps of meat,) You need to spend some of your money on the following items:
- INGREDIENTS: Eat or starve (and die, but as your source of charity, I'm being optimistic)
- COOKWARE: Cook your food (or don't and become true jackasses that die to prove a point)
- WEAPONS: Get a weapon (unless you think your fists are more than glorified monster food)
- ARMOR: Armor gives you a chance to survive an attack (and not die like unceremonious jackasses)
You can spend all of your money here before you start your journey (I'm quite generous too),
or you can save some to spend on my fellow (and stingy) merchants along the way.
But beware, some of my fellow merchants are quite the penny-pinchers,
so they won't play fair with prices...
